Hey! My name's Abdurrehman (you can call me Abaan)!

I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I have experience working with full-stack projects and am accustomed to using languages such as JavaScript and HTML, as well as technologies like Ajax and Node.js.

My full technical skills are listed below:
- Languages: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML5, MIPS
- Frameworks & Technologies: Node.js, Ionic, ReactJS, Flutter, React Native, Ajax

In my free time, I like writing, sketching, and reading. I look forward to contributing to the world of technology in any way possible!
