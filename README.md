Hey, my name's Abaan!

I'm a software engineer based out of Austin, TX with a degree in computer science from The University of Texas at Dallas. I have experience working with full-stack projects and am accustomed to using languages such as Java and C++, as well as technologies like React, Hadoop, and Spark.

I'm currently learning Dropwizard and Kubernetes, and hope to expand my knowledge in AWS and cloud services.

Some of my technical skills are listed below:
- Languages: C, C++, Java, Kotlin, SQL, JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, Bash
- Frameworks & Technologies: Hadoop, Spark, GraphQL, React, JUnit, Tailwind CSS
- Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux

In my free time, I like writing, sketching, and reading. I look forward to contributing to the world of technology in any way possible.
